                    <h2>Chapter 1: Memories</h2>
                        <p>
                            How quickly does time fly? Not long ago, I was sitting with you on the same freaking bench and playing 
                            Pictionary to drive away boredom caused by that math sir or having snacks opposite the Shopper’s Point building 
                            or having maggi in Cama or walking to Juhu from there🙃. Feels so weird thinking that it's been a whole 4 years 
                            since the last time we did any of 😢. Though there’s no point in walking to Juhu from Andheri😂, except that, I 
                            would do anything to live those days back. To quote Naina from YJHD "Yaadein mithai ke dabbe ki tarah hoti hai, 
                            ek baar khula toh sirf ek tukda nahi khaa paoge" and this is exactly what I am feeling rn. I can’t write a 
                            specific memory as it would be unfair to the rest of them. Talking about unfairness, we can’t miss out on the 
                            memories we made outside of Pace, well I meant after we left it cuz we didn’t really make any outside when we 
                            were in Pace cuz “studies”💀. The dry spell continues till this day, I wonder why?🤔. Whether it is constantly 
                            roasting Aryan and Vishal, or us having our tea time about each other’s college life, these are memories to me 
                            whatsoever, and the best ones might I add😍. They will always stick with me no matter what and will be equally 
                            cherished. We may have talked less in the past years, but guess what, it turned out to be a trial period for the 
                            coming years😜. On a serious note, I am sorry if that has been considered a bad factor for our friendship, but 
                            the way I see it, it has in no-way broken our bond. I still see you as the Het I interacted with 6 years back😘. 
                            It rather has only strengthened it, these memories made us come back to each other in the past 4 years and I am 
                            sure that they are more than enough to continue to, even though you’ll be miles apart this time😭😭😭. 
                            Congratulations on making it to F-ing “USC”!!!!!🥳. Couldn’t have been more proud😘.Here’s to the start of a 
                            beautiful chapter and a somewhat end of one, but you always go back to your favorite books and ik I am one of them! 🤭

                        In publishing and graphic design, Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the 
                        visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum may be used as a 
                        placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called 
                        greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the 
                        text influencing the design.Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 
                        1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to 
                        make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of 'dolorem ipsum' 
                        ('pain itself').
                        Versions of the Lorem ipsum text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized 
                        by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.[1] Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, 
                        when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. 
                        Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted Lorem ipsum,[2] as have 
                        many LaTeX packages,[3][4][5] web content managers such as Joomla! and WordPress, and CSS libraries such as 
                        Semantic UI.[
