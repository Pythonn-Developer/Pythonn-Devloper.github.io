                    <h2>Chapter 1: Memories</h2>
                        <p>
                            How quickly does time fly? Not long ago, I was sitting with you on the same freaking bench and playing 
                            Pictionary to drive away boredom caused by that math sir or having snacks opposite the Shopper’s Point building 
                            or having maggi in Cama or walking to Juhu from there🙃. Feels so weird thinking that it's been a whole 4 years 
                            since the last time we did any of 😢. Though there’s no point in walking to Juhu from Andheri😂, except that, I 
                            would do anything to live those days back. To quote Naina from YJHD "Yaadein mithai ke dabbe ki tarah hoti hai, 
                            ek baar khula toh sirf ek tukda nahi khaa paoge" and this is exactly what I am feeling rn. I can’t write a 
                            specific memory as it would be unfair to the rest of them. Talking about unfairness, we can’t miss out on the 
                            memories we made outside of Pace, well I meant after we left it cuz we didn’t really make any outside when we 
                            were in Pace cuz “studies”💀. The dry spell continues till this day, I wonder why?🤔. Whether it is constantly 
                            roasting Aryan and Vishal, or us having our tea time about each other’s college life, these are memories to me 
                            whatsoever, and the best ones might I add😍. They will always stick with me no matter what and will be equally 
                            cherished. We may have talked less in the past years, but guess what, it turned out to be a trial period for the 
                            coming years😜. On a serious note, I am sorry if that has been considered a bad factor for our friendship, but 
                            the way I see it, it has in no-way broken our bond. I still see you as the Het I interacted with 6 years back😘. 
                            It rather has only strengthened it, these memories made us come back to each other in the past 4 years and I am 
                            sure that they are more than enough to continue to, even though you’ll be miles apart this time😭😭😭. 
                            Congratulations on making it to F-ing “USC”!!!!!🥳. Couldn’t have been more proud😘.Here’s to the start of a 
                            beautiful chapter and a somewhat end of one, but you always go back to your favorite books and ik I am one of them! 🤭

                    <h2>Chapter 2: No Matter Where ...</h2>
                    <p>
                        First things first, apologies for the late update on this chapter😭. USC is a damn big deal and I can’t 
                        congratulate you enough for it😘. It’s all fun and games until I realized you are gonna be 8,490 miles i.e 13,663 
                        from us😭. Let that thought sink in!💀😞. I can no longer casually call you to meet up at Infinity or someplace and 
                        cancel plans last minute knowing we cannot meet anytime soon😢. And that’s the only regret I have about our 
                        friendship. Well, besides not giving you cards on your bday 🙃(but dw, I am on it!🫡). I can no longer do our yearly 
                        ritual of attending garba night at your building🥹. Umm, I would like to change my vote of regret to this🙃, 
                        since my only ‘gujju’ friend is leaving me unattended for navratri from hereon. But I'll make you proud by attending 
                        it somewhere (- your gujju dupatta 😂) and make sure to send you pictures of the same. To turn the tables around 
                        (why should only you have fun😜), I’d also like you to think about the things you can no longer do. For eg: have the 
                        amazing vada pav😋 round the corner of your gully, or have street food in Mahavir Nagar or just anywhere. Cuz desi 
                        food is desi, you don’t get that taste anywhere😌. I’ll certainly do that on your behalf and send you pictures of 
                        that as well🌚. I can hear the “Yeh bandi na maar khaane wale hai '' coming, but if it were you, I am sure you would 
                        have done the same😌. It goes without saying that even though we won’t be in the same city (or country even🥹), I 
                        am always a phone call or better even a video call away from everything. Because one, we love to gossip☕, and 
                        second I can’t wait to find out how you go about without aunty there to shop for you😂. Notice that while I pen 
                        down all these moments without you, I keep saying that I will ensure to still call you or send pictures. That, to me, 
                        tells me that ‘No matter where you go’, I will always seek my friend (even though I am sometimes late🤐) to come to 
                        for advice and share my life details with and ik it’s true vice versa❤️. Because this friendship feels more like a 
                        home🥰 that ik I am welcome to anytime and ik I can always find my way back to it even if I get lost….. And you should 
                        too🤭😘. So your stupid ass better not forget your nibbi.😒
