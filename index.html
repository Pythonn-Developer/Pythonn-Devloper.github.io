                    <h2>Chapter 1: Memories</h2>
                        <p>
                            How quickly does time fly? Not long ago, I was sitting with you on the same freaking bench and playing 
                            Pictionary to drive away boredom caused by that math sir or having snacks opposite the Shopper’s Point building 
                            or having maggi in Cama or walking to Juhu from there🙃. Feels so weird thinking that it's been a whole 4 years 
                            since the last time we did any of 😢. Though there’s no point in walking to Juhu from Andheri😂, except that, I 
                            would do anything to live those days back. To quote Naina from YJHD "Yaadein mithai ke dabbe ki tarah hoti hai, 
                            ek baar khula toh sirf ek tukda nahi khaa paoge" and this is exactly what I am feeling rn. I can’t write a 
                            specific memory as it would be unfair to the rest of them. Talking about unfairness, we can’t miss out on the 
                            memories we made outside of Pace, well I meant after we left it cuz we didn’t really make any outside when we 
                            were in Pace cuz “studies”💀. The dry spell continues till this day, I wonder why?🤔. Whether it is constantly 
                            roasting Aryan and Vishal, or us having our tea time about each other’s college life, these are memories to me 
                            whatsoever, and the best ones might I add😍. They will always stick with me no matter what and will be equally 
                            cherished. We may have talked less in the past years, but guess what, it turned out to be a trial period for the 
                            coming years😜. On a serious note, I am sorry if that has been considered a bad factor for our friendship, but 
                            the way I see it, it has in no-way broken our bond. I still see you as the Het I interacted with 6 years back😘. 
                            It rather has only strengthened it, these memories made us come back to each other in the past 4 years and I am 
                            sure that they are more than enough to continue to, even though you’ll be miles apart this time😭😭😭. 
                            Congratulations on making it to F-ing “USC”!!!!!🥳. Couldn’t have been more proud😘.Here’s to the start of a 
                            beautiful chapter and a somewhat end of one, but you always go back to your favorite books and ik I am one of them! 🤭

                    <h2>Chapter 2: No Matter Where ...</h2>
                    <p>
                        First things first, apologies for the late update on this chapter😭. USC is a damn big deal and I can’t 
                        congratulate you enough for it😘. It’s all fun and games until I realized you are gonna be 8,490 miles i.e 13,663 
                        from us😭. Let that thought sink in!💀😞. I can no longer casually call you to meet up at Infinity or someplace and 
                        cancel plans last minute knowing we cannot meet anytime soon😢. And that’s the only regret I have about our 
                        friendship. Well, besides not giving you cards on your bday 🙃(but dw, I am on it!🫡). I can no longer do our yearly 
                        ritual of attending garba night at your building🥹. Umm, I would like to change my vote of regret to this🙃, 
                        since my only ‘gujju’ friend is leaving me unattended for navratri from hereon. But I'll make you proud by attending 
                        it somewhere (- your gujju dupatta 😂) and make sure to send you pictures of the same. To turn the tables around 
                        (why should only you have fun😜), I’d also like you to think about the things you can no longer do. For eg: have the 
                        amazing vada pav😋 round the corner of your gully, or have street food in Mahavir Nagar or just anywhere. Cuz desi 
                        food is desi, you don’t get that taste anywhere😌. I’ll certainly do that on your behalf and send you pictures of 
                        that as well🌚. I can hear the “Yeh bandi na maar khaane wale hai '' coming, but if it were you, I am sure you would 
                        have done the same😌. It goes without saying that even though we won’t be in the same city (or country even🥹), I 
                        am always a phone call or better even a video call away from everything. Because one, we love to gossip☕, and 
                        second I can’t wait to find out how you go about without aunty there to shop for you😂. Notice that while I pen 
                        down all these moments without you, I keep saying that I will ensure to still call you or send pictures. That, to me, 
                        tells me that ‘No matter where you go’, I will always seek my friend (even though I am sometimes late🤐) to come to 
                        for advice and share my life details with and ik it’s true vice versa❤️. Because this friendship feels more like a 
                        home🥰 that ik I am welcome to anytime and ik I can always find my way back to it even if I get lost….. And you should 
                        too🤭😘. So your stupid ass better not forget your nibbi.😒

                    <p>
                        So really sorry that you have to read your letters the next day😭. This one is from everyone’s side (cuz i think 
                        everyone will be on the same page as me)🥹. While we are thrilled to see you achieve your dreams and we love seeing 
                        the goofy you😘, but it's time to realize that you are now a responsible 22 year old kid🤐. Whether it is to pick up 
                        your clothes after messing up the room, going shopping or packing your bags (had to bring it up at least once 😂), 
                        you are gonna have to do it all by yourself. Not that we doubt your capabilities of being a strong and an independent 
                        girl, we know you can completely handle it, yourself😌. It's just sometimes being away from home can make one feel 
                        lonely and have lots of other thoughts😓, (I pray that it doesn’t ever happen🙏🏻), but if it does and if you are unable 
                        to share it with any of us, this letter is intended to find you at this exact moment🤗.
                        <br>
	                    While we physically can’t relieve you of what you are feeling, know that we are constantly cheering for you🥳 
                        irrespective of the distance and waiting for you to come to what you call “home”🤗 to return the favor. We believe 
                        in you and trust that whatever may come your way, you will fight it like the strong girl we all know you are😤. So 
                        don’t lose hope and patience, you're gonna get there🥰! Work hard and you will reap its sweet fruits, but even if 
                        you don’t, it’s gonna be alright😘. However, never neglect yourself while you are working towards it because as much 
                        as dreams matter, so does your happiness and health😤😒. So stay strong and give yourself a pat on the back for you are 
                        doing a wonderful job and we are proud of you!🥳. Mummy wala feeling aa rha hai abhi.
                        <br>
                        Enjoy your time there! We know you're gonna rock it🤪 learn to dance though 😂! To quote Aman from Kal Ho Na Ho 
                        “Haso, jiyo, khush raho, muskurao”, it's all about the climb!❤️

                    <p>
                        Let's start with a quote today. “Good friends are like stars, you might not always see them, but you know they are 
                        there”🥰. I read this a while back and didn’t realize what it meant until I had to mentally set myself for your 
                        departure🥹. While I am preparing myself for your farewell (which isn't going great btw😤), all I keep thinking and 
                        telling you is how and what we’ll do after you come back 🤐(which I keep hoping is soon🥲) or how we’ll stay in 
                        touch. And honestly this thought puts me at ease telling me that this is definitely not the last time❤️! There are 
                        more times to come, where the older, mature, hopefully responsible😂 and still goofy😜 us will meet to share tons 
                        of gossip☕(Yes it's an absolute necessity to hold onto gossip traditions😤) just like old times. In other words, 
                        the end of your countdown for farewell, marks the beginning of the countdown for your arrival😌. Which btw we all 
                        are gonna be so excited about🥳 cuz of the gifts you’ll get along (duh)😌🌚 nobody’s interested in you, excuse me🙃. 
                        Well, we cared enough to send you off at the airport, utna toh you owe us😌🙃. We'll finally be seeing you roll out 
                        those bags (which your mom packed🤐) to let your dreams fly✈️. And we are gonna be there with you the whole journey 
                        as you will not just be traveling alone with a bunch of bags, you will rather be traveling with lots of love from a whole 
                        ass gang who’s gonna miss you to their core❤️. So, hold onto all the memories so far because ik they will lead you 
                        home🤗, Until Next Time bro.

                    <p>
                        I don’t know where to begin for this chapter (or should I say idk how to end this?) as ik this isn’t the end. 
                        What a ride this has been!!! I am still processing the fact that it’s already the day you leave 😢. Gonna keep this one short 
                        and sweet, just like you😘. The boomerang on the left properly defines the goofy us or (us in general😂), gonna miss 
                        doing all stupid things like these with you. Wish you the best of luck, have the time of your life, enjoy every bit and
                        it goes without saying keep in touch. I am feeling a lot of things, it’s so hard to say Goodbye!😭😭. And ik you must feel the
                        same for a lot of people but let me remind you that the pain of parting is nothing compared to the joy of meeting again. 
                        So, in a time like such I'd rather ask you to say Hello. Hello to a new adventure that awaits! 
                        Also because Maya from Kank said "Alvida kehne se phir milne ki ummed mar jaati hai, kya pata phir milen." So, see you!
                        (asap😭)
                        <br><br>
	                    Note that we are geographically parting ways, not by heart, so don’t you dare to forget the girl who wrote you so 
                        many letters.. Signing out with the letter and card duties😜. Until next time! peace out. ❤️
                        <br><br>
