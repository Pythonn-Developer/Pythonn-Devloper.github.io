                    <h1>4 Days To Go!</h1>
                    <h2>Chapter 1: Memories</h2>
                        <p>
                            How quickly does time fly? Not long ago, I was sitting with you on the same freaking bench and playing 
                            Pictionary to drive away boredom caused by that math sir or having snacks opposite the Shopper’s Point building 
                            or having maggi in Cama or walking to Juhu from there🙃. Feels so weird thinking that it's been a whole 4 years 
                            since the last time we did any of 😢. Though there’s no point in walking to Juhu from Andheri😂, except that, I 
                            would do anything to live those days back. To quote Naina from YJHD "Yaadein mithai ke dabbe ki tarah hoti hai, 
                            ek baar khula toh sirf ek tukda nahi khaa paoge" and this is exactly what I am feeling rn. I can’t write a 
                            specific memory as it would be unfair to the rest of them. Talking about unfairness, we can’t miss out on the 
                            memories we made outside of Pace, well I meant after we left it cuz we didn’t really make any outside when we 
                            were in Pace cuz “studies”💀. The dry spell continues till this day, I wonder why?🤔. Whether it is constantly 
                            roasting Aryan and Vishal, or us having our tea time about each other’s college life, these are memories to me 
                            whatsoever, and the best ones might I add😍. They will always stick with me no matter what and will be equally 
                            cherished. We may have talked less in the past years, but guess what, it turned out to be a trial period for the 
                            coming years😜. On a serious note, I am sorry if that has been considered a bad factor for our friendship, but 
                            the way I see it, it has in no-way broken our bond. I still see you as the Het I interacted with 6 years back😘. 
                            It rather has only strengthened it, these memories made us come back to each other in the past 4 years and I am 
                            sure that they are more than enough to continue to, even though you’ll be miles apart this time😭😭😭. 
                            Congratulations on making it to F-ing “USC”!!!!!🥳. Couldn’t have been more proud😘.Here’s to the start of a 
                            beautiful chapter and a somewhat end of one, but you always go back to your favorite books and ik I am one of them! 🤭
